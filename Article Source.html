<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Thinking out of the box is the key to find new solutions: «<i>If you want something you've never had, you must be willing to do something you've never done</i>.» [Thomas Jefferson]. After a century SIR is squeezed like a lemon. Maybe new ways to tackle the same problem will lead to new solutions.</p>

<p>I developed this application, during the first lockdown: April-June 2020. There are many applications like this on the internet. What makes this application different is that it doesn't rely on the SIR model's equation at all.</p>

<p>The SIR model is one century back in time when scientific paradigms were different. For example, SIR is a linear model and nature is everything but linear. I'm not saying SIR is not good. It is good, but it must be managed carefully: keep in mind that 'R' in 'SIR' means 'Recovered' and doesn't matter if the person is healed or died!</p>

<p>(Let me suggest this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6NnCOs20GQ">The secret life of chaos</a> from Professor Jim Al-Khalili, BBC 4)</p>

<iframe style="width:560px; height:315px" src="./Article Source_files/R6NnCOs20GQ.html" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>So, I believe, there is enough room to think about other complementary models. The idea behind this application is very easy. The code tries to model the reality: there is a region (a selected surface, for example, a city;) There are people that move over the region. And there is a disease (CoViD for example) A disease contaminates an area, when someone moves over the area, gets infected and after a short latency becomes ill (purple dot in the GUI's left panel). Then, the infected person, sneezing and touching, contaminates other points over the region. After a while, the person recovers. To make the model more precise, there are also other entities that act like 'accumulation points' like schools; hospitals, and offices. Even the evolution of the virus into an infected body was modeled avoiding the SIR equations. In this case, to make things easy, evolution is an array of values. The evolution should be provided by virologists. (One first result shows that the disease's spread is tightly correlated with the topology, instead of the characteristics of the virus.)</p>

<p>The model allows parametrizing most of the key factors affecting the spread of the disease. On one hand that makes the model very powerful, being able to represent many possible dynamics. On the other hand, all this versatility can be disorienting.</p>

<p>I tried to do my best to make the implementation as modular and scalable as possible. I know, doing better is always possible and I hope there will be contributors to making this project better. (For example: on youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo5-H52ACRw" target="_blank">I published a video</a> of the running application. I know it's horrible: 'media' is where my skills fall down to zero. Can someone help me do better?)</p>

<p>An article about an event like CoVid is very difficult to write. And what I wrote is just a little pebble in the pond. I will be happy to spend all the time needed to dive into this project if the 'web' will show interest in it.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The project is developed in C#. The solution is an MDI developed using Visual Studio Community 2019 ver 16.4.5. The architecture is simple. Sometimes algorithms are not.</p>

<h2>Using the Application</h2>

<h3>Forms</h3>

<p>Children forms can be:</p>

<h4>Infection</h4>

<p>This represents the dynamic of the number of viruses and antibodies once a person gets infected. (The example shows the easiest option: a discontinue function. In fact, from the point of view of this application, what we care about is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_period_(epidemiology)#:~:text=In%20epidemiology%2C%20particularly%20in%20the,becomes%20infectious%2C%20i.e.%20capable%20of">latency period</a> and when the person stops being contagious. (The second diagram should contain the evolution of the antibodies.)</p>

<p><img src="./Article Source_files/MDI-Infection.png" style="width: 640px; height: 483px"></p>

<h4>Spread</h4>

<p>(The main representation) is the spread of the epidemy over a region. The left panel shows people moving over the region and their states (Susceptible, ill, ...). In this example, pink dots are ill people. The right panel shows a region, the place where people live, and where the epidemic spreads. A red dot is a contaminated area.</p>

<p><img src="./Article Source_files/MDI-Spread.png" style="width: 640px; height: 471px"></p>

<h4>Person</h4>

<p>Represents the dynamic of viruses; the movement of the person and the place contaminated by the person. (This form shows the same data shown from the other forms, limited to one person.)</p>

<p><img src="./Article Source_files/MDI-Person.png" style="width: 640px; height: 715px"></p>

<h2>Diagrams</h2>

<p><img src="./Article Source_files/Grid.png" style="width: 259px; height: 743px"></p>

<p>One key concept is the '<b>Grid</b>': it is a square region made of points. (Simulates the place where people live and where the epidemic spreads.) Analyzing the grid means to loop over a matrix. To avoid this, there is the field "contaminated", a list of points referencing contaminated points over the grid. Experience shows this list is always a small fraction of the grid and that makes this solution strategically acceptable for keep good performances.</p>

<p>Another key concept is '<b>Ticks</b>', a unity of time (20 minutes, more or less.) based on the dynamic of the virus and designed to take a limited number of 'Ticks' to describe the full evolution of a virus.</p>

<p><img height="1033px" src="./Article Source_files/Person.png" width="307px"></p>

<p>Obviously, <code><b>Person</b></code> is another key concept. <code>Person.<b>Viruses</b></code> is the number of viruses. Should be regarded as the number of "unities" of viruses. <code>Person.<b>Locations</b></code> (list of points) the coordinates of the key points reached by the person. The person moves from a location to another with many 'steps' along a segment joining two consecutive locations. (the full movement is a broken line starting from the first location -usually home- to the last location.</p>

<p><img height="402px" src="./Article Source_files/Popolation.png" width="235px"></p>

<p>The class <code><strong>Popolation</strong></code> is merely a container for statistics data.</p>

<p>The last class is '<code><b>Virus</b></code>', it is empty. That's because it is not important to model how the viruses evolve. What we care about is the final result: an array of the number of viruses (in a person) as a function of time.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and Points of Interest</h2>

<p>Many questions were raised while writing this project:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Theoretically, an infection can start even if a single virus attacks a body. Is that true?</li>	<li>There are viruses that are very lethal, CoViD19 seems to be lethal mainly for elderly people. Should we count the death of a sick and old person in the same as the death of a young and strong person? Is that ethically correct? Is that analytically correct?</li>	<li>Which can be a model of a disease capable to kill (only) a sick person? A proposed solution is to count the number of the lost residual days of life, instead of the life itself.</li>	<li>Is the model implemented in this project good enough? Are there any other factors that must be taken into account?</li></ul>
